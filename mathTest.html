        <h3>2023-2025</h3>
        <p>ARML is a national team-based competition held every June. My school sends 3 teams of 15 people each to compete. I greatly enjoy this competition because of the team bonding experiences. We sing karoake, play lots of card games and in general have a lot of fun at this competition. This year, our team won 4th place nationally!</p>

        <h3>2023-2024</h3>
        <p>BMT is another national team-based competition held in December. Each team of 6 meets online to do problems with each other. I personally feel like this competition is better if the whole team can meet together in the same room, but is otherwise pretty good. In 2023 my team won 2nd place nationally.</p>

        <h2>Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT)</h2>
        <h3>2022 (Nov), 2025 (Feb)</h3>
        <p>HMMT is a competition held in both November and February of each year, with the latter being more difficult. I love this competition because each problem is very high quality, rarely creating complaints from competitors. In 2022 my team won 8th place.</p>

        <h2>Princeton Univercity Math Competition (PuMAC)</h2>
        <h3>2024</h3>
        <p>PuMAC is a competition held every November, but has not had a great reputation in our school. When I went, I found that a lot of the questions were scuffed and low quality, resulting in a lot of complaints and voided questions.</p>

        <h2>Carnegie Mellon International Math Competition (CMIMC)</h2>
        <h3>2025</h3>
        <p>CMIMC is perhaps the most challenging competition on this list. It provides a unique challenge with completely different problem styles, involving a lot more thought instead of mindless computation.</p>

        <p>MAML is a two stage math competition, the first round being multiple choice, and the second round being proofs. The competition is only held for the students in Massachusetts, and top placers in the second round can earn money. So far I've won 4th, 10th, and 7th place over the last 3 seasons.</p>

        <p>The AMC series is the largest math competition in America, created to select students for the American International Math Olympiad team. In 2023 I was top 1% of students, and in 2024 I was top 5%.</p>
